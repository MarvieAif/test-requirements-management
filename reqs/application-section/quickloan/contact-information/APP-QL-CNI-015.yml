text: 'If co-applicant chooses "yes" for "same address", then main applicant changes their address, the previous radio choice should not persist and switch to "no" automatically.  If co-applicant and main applicant both input the same address (But not living here field), the radio should automatically switch to "yes".  If co-applicant chooses "yes" for "same address", under the section "Does the co-applicant share the same address with the applicant?" the current address section should be disabled, and the address saved into DB should be the same as the main applicant'
